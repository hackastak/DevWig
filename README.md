- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevWig
- 👀 I'm a mechanical engineer turned biomedical engineer turned software engineer, and I can finally say, I'm here to stay.
- 🌱 I enjoy learning anything and everything I can get my hands on. Currently learning to use neovim as my primary dev environment.
- 💞️ I’m always open to collaborate on just about anything. The only qualification is that it just has to spark an interest with me.
      Most of my experience is with web related projects in JavaScript, but I'd love to learn by doing with security as well.
       **HTML** && **CSS** && **TailwindCSS** && **JavaScript** && **React** && **NextJS** && **Astro** && **Java** && **Spring Boot** && **SQL** && **Appwrite** && **Supabase** && **Firebase**
