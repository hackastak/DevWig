- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevWig
- 👀 I'm a mechanical engineer turned biomedical engineer turned software engineer, and I can finally say, I'm here to stay.
- 🌱 I’m enjoy learning anything and everything I can get my hands on. Currently, that consists of learning Astro as well as getting familiar with Appwrite and Vercel.
- 💞️ I’m always open to collaborate on just about anything. The only qualification is that it just has to spark an interest with me.
     Most of my experience is with web related projects in JavaScript, but I'd love to learn by doing with security as well.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at ahwig93@gmail.com
